      To provide familiarity with these page layout techniques, we'll show you a
      couple of quick examples. Our examples will all feature the same HTML,
      which is as follows.
    </p>

    <h1>Positioning</h1>

    <p>I am a basic block level element.</p>
    <p class="positioned">I am a basic block level element.</p>
    <p>I am a basic block level element.</p>

    <p>
      <em>Relative positioning</em> allows you to offset an item from the
      position in normal flow it would have by default. <br /><br />
      means you could achieve a task such as moving an icon down a bit so it
      lines up with a text label.<br /><br />
      To do this, we could add the following rule to add relative
      positioning.<br /><br />
      Here we give our middle paragraph a position value of relative — this
      doesn't do anything on its own, so we also add top and left properties.<br /><br />
      These serve to move the affected element down and to the right — this
      might seem like the opposite of what you were expecting, but you need to
      think of it as the element being pushed on its left and top sides, which
      results in it moving right and down.<br /><br />
      We will also give it a different background and border to make it stand
      out.<br /><br />
      <em>
        Try changing the values for top and left -- also try removing them and
        using values for bottom and right -- See how those change the
        positioning of the element.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Absolute positioning</em> is used to completely remove an element from
      the normal flow and place it using offsets from the edges of a containing
      block. We could add the following CSS rule to implement absolute
      positioning.<br /><br />
      This is very different! The positioned element has now been completely
      separated from the rest of the page layout and sits over the top of it.<br /><br />
      The other two paragraphs now sit together as if their positioned sibling
      doesn't exist.<br /><br />
      The top and left properties have a different effect on absolutely
      positioned elements than they do on relatively positioned elements.<br /><br />
      In this case, the offsets have been calculated from the top and left of
      the page.<br /><br />
      It is possible to change the parent element that becomes this container,
      and we will take a look at that later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Fixed positioning</em> removes our element from document flow in the
      same way as absolute positioning.<br /><br />
      However, instead of the offsets being applied from the container, they are
      applied from the viewport.<br /><br />
      As the item remains fixed in relation to the viewport, we can create
      effects such as a menu that remains fixed as the page scrolls beneath
      it.<br /><br />
      For this example, our HTML is three paragraphs of text so that we can
      cause the page to scroll and a box to which we will give position: fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Sticky positioning</em> Sticky positioning is the final positioning
      method that we have at our disposal.<br /><br />
      It mixes the default static positioning with fixed positioning.<br /><br />
      When an item has position: sticky, it will scroll in normal flow until it
      hits offsets from the viewport that we have defined.<br /><br />
      At that point, it becomes "stuck" as if it had position: fixed applied.
