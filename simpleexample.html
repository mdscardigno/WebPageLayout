      To provide familiarity with these page layout techniques, we'll show you a
      couple of quick examples. Our examples will all feature the same HTML,
      which is as follows.
    </p>

    <h1>Positioning</h1>

    <p>I am a basic block level element.</p>
    <p class="positioned">I am a basic block level element.</p>
    <p>I am a basic block level element.</p>

      Relative positioning allows you to offset an item from the position in
      normal flow it would have by default. <br /><br />
      means you could achieve a task such as moving an icon down a bit so it
      lines up with a text label.<br /><br />
      To do this, we could add the following rule to add relative
      positioning.<br /><br />
      Here we give our middle paragraph a position value of relative — this
      doesn't do anything on its own, so we also add top and left properties.<br /><br />
      These serve to move the affected element down and to the right — this
      might seem like the opposite of what you were expecting, but you need to
      think of it as the element being pushed on its left and top sides, which
      results in it moving right and down.<br /><br />
      We will also give it a different background and border to make it stand
      out.<br /><br />
      <em>
        Try changing the values for top and left -- also try removing them and
        using values for bottom and right -- See how those change the
        positioning of the element.</em
