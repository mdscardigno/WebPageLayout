      Positioning allows you to move an element from where it would be placed
      when in normal flow to another location. Positioning isn’t a method for
      creating your main page layouts, it is more about managing and fine-tuning
      the position of specific items on the page. There are however useful
      techniques for certain layout patterns that rely on the position property.
      Understanding positioning also helps in understanding normal flow and what
      it is to move an item out of the normal flow.

      There are five types of positioning you should know about:
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Static Positioning:</strong> he default that every element gets
        — just means "put the element into its normal position in the document
        layout flow — nothing special to see here."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Relative Positioning:</strong> Allows you to modify an element's
        position on the page, moving it relative to its position in normal flow
        — including making it overlap other elements on the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Absolute Positioning:</strong> Moves an element completely out
        of the page's normal layout flow, like it is sitting on a separate layer
        on its own. From there, you can fix it in a position relative to the
        edges of the page's html element (or its nearest positioned ancestor
        element). This is useful for creating complex layout effects such as
        tabbed boxes where different content panels sit on top of one another
        and are shown and hidden as desired, or information panels that sit
        off-screen by default but can be made to slide on screen using a control
        button.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fixed Positioning:</strong> Very similar to absolute
        positioning, except that it fixes an element relative to the browser
        viewport, not another element. This is useful for creating effects such
        as a persistent navigation menu that always stays in the same place on
        the screen as the rest of the content scrolls.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sticky Positioning:</strong> This is a newer positioning method
        that makes an element act like position: static until it hits a defined
        offset from the viewport, at which point it acts like position: fixed.
      </li>
    </ul>
